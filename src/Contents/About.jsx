                <p>Iâ€™m Michael Z. Sabino, a recent graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering and a passion for programming and software development. I am interested in innovative software solutions and dynamic websites. Developing software and websites is my ambition. I was a backend developer and sometimes worked as a full-stack in my recent internship at an IT solution company using PHP Laravel framework and MariaDB for the database. I work many projects before when I was in college days accepting freelance work from my co-students and other schools for their projects like websites and software using Java and website development tools I also know Photoshop and some editing for designs. I created with my team a mobile application for battery savers integrated with a microcontroller in our recent internship I worked as a backend for this project. My projects showcase my commitment to problem-solving, attention to detail, and eagerness to learn and adapt. I thrive on tackling complex challenges and am excited to bring fresh perspectives and creativity to the tech industry.</p>
